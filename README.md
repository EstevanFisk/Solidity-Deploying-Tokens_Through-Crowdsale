# Solidity-Deploying-Tokens_Through-Crowdsale

## Overview
We will create a custom coin called the "KaseiCoin", which you will deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html), and [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/). This will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. You will then launch a crowdsale that will allow people to purchase your KaseiCoin so you can raise funds in wei (ether).
